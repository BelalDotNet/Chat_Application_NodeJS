======================================================
Project Description :
This Chat Application is made based on NodeJs server side and Best combination with WebSocket Client  tool for dublex communication. 
At the beginning every user can select their name and the server will assign them and will post some system message to the chat window 
that a new user just connected. Then the user can post messages. When a user closes the browser window, server will post another system massage to the window that a user has disconnected.
Also, every new user will receive entire message history.Text Message and Image Proccessing are working on this chat-application.


Great advantage of WebSocket is two way communication.

then server sends that message to all conected users (server -> client) â€” broadcast.
